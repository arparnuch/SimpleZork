My game story :

- Level 1 : "From Hell to Earth"
    There is a man named "Meow" who love his cat very much. Since it died, he
  tries to find a way to revive it. He go to ask the elder of his village.
  The elder said that if the owner could find his cat soul just in time, his cat
  will become a cat fairy due to the power of love. The first place the man
  thought is Hell since his cat always steals his meal every time possible.
  Finally, he manages to get into Hell. However, he realize that his cal soul
  does not stay in the place. Entering Hell is easy but leaving is not going to
  be easy as he thought.

    His objective is to retrieve 10 souls of devil monster using it to power the
  exit gate. So that, he can go back to the human world.

  - Level 2 : "The way to Heaven is not so easy either!"
    After exiting from Hell, Meow can only thought of the last place left that
  his cat soul would go, "Heaven". In order to gain access to Heaven, Meow ask
  the wicked witch for help. The witch will cast the ancient magic to send the
  human to Heaven. However, she asks for "Golden Feather" in return which will
  be drop from Golden Hen only.

    His objective is to retrieve a Golden Feather from Golden Hen (The chance of
  dropping is quite small). Then, he will trade the feather for the assist of
  the witch.

  - Level 3 : "Where is my cat!!!"
    After a very long journey, the human thought "Finally, I will find my cat!!".
  The truth is that it is not so easy. All souls entered into the heaven will alter
  their shapes into human forms. If he choose the right one, his cat will become
  a cat fairy and live with him forever. Otherwise, he will be separated from
  his beloved cat forever.

    His objective is to talk with every souls in the heaven (three to be exact)
  and try to identify which one is his beloved cat. Then, he will go to tell
  the main guardian of Heaven of his decision.
