My game story :

- Level 1 : "From Hell to Earth"
    There is a man named "Meow" who love his cat very much. Since it died, he
  tries to find a way to revive it. He go to ask the elder of his village.
  The elder said that if the owner could find his cat soul just in time, his cat
  will become a cat fairy due to the power of love. The first place the man
  thought is Hell since his cat always steals his meal every time possible.
  Finally, he manages to get into Hell. However, he realize that his cal soul
  does not stay in the place. Entering Hell is easy but leaving is not going to
  be easy as he thought.

    His objective is to retrieve 3 souls of devil monster using it to power the
  exit gate. So that, he can go back to the human world.

  - Level 2 : "The way to Heaven is not so easy either!"
    After exiting from Hell, Meow can only thought of the last place left that
  his cat soul would go, "Heaven". In order to gain access to Heaven, Meow has
  to fight his way through to the Heaven!

    His objective is to kill all the monster in Level 2.!

  - Level 3 : "Where is my cat!!!?"
    After a very long journey, the human thought "Finally, I will find my cat!!".
  The truth is that it is not so easy. His cat soul now belongs to the Devil Cat!
  Again, the owner must defeat the monster to release the cat soul. However, the
  monster appear randomly. The owner has to find it searching room by room.

    His objective is to find and kill the boss of Level 3!!!.
